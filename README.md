## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- It need to be build using ReactJS
- It has to support pagination. The users will only be shown the page selected by them. The other pages shouldnâ€™t be loaded if not necessary
- A locally-stored bookmarking feature needs to be provided so the users can pin their favourite books and browse it easily in a dedicated Bookmark section
- When a user is viewing the list of books of a category, a search feature is required to help him/her easily find the books based on title or author.
